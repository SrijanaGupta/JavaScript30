    console.log(age, age2);//age2 just creates a COPY of age, so original can be changed irrespective of it.

    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    players.pop();
    console.log(players);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(team);// team is REFERENCE of players, so any changes made to players(original array) would change the team as well
    //It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    console.log(team2);

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    console.log(team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    /* Similarly in case of objects also, we cannot make a reference */

        name:'Srijana Gupta',

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const obj4 = {...obj};
    obj4.username = 'guptsrija';
    console.log(obj4);
    console.log(obj);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    /* Object.assign works only one level deep i.e.; only on the immediate property of an obj */
